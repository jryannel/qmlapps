# Concept

The photo kiosk main functionality is to display photos provided by the user or via a web-service. The photos displayed will be animated by some effects and also the transition between photos can be animated. 

It is possible to show a footer/header to display some status information:

Header
- Name of the kiosk
- Current Time
- Weather
- Settings Icon

Footer
- Current Picture Path
- Available Space, Space used


The settings icon can be used to switch to the settings page. Here the user can select the different supported operations:

- sources and criteria (e.g. use flickr service and display images with tags 'munich').
- photo display animation
- photo transition animation can be selected here
- kiosk name
